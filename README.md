# Julia_CVision_V1.8
This repo contains Computer Vision exercises with updated functions for Version 1.8.
The exercises come mainly from Packt's book "Hands On Computer Vision with Julia", with added changes to my liking.
No copyright infringement is intended.

Every deprecated function has been substituded taking as reference official Release Notes.
